# Medical Reasoning System using simple python

This system is capable of diagnosing respiratory illnesses and decide if someone is having just a common cold or flu. 
The system requests the user to enter the symptoms as input and it checks if the symptom is flu or common cold.
Also, if the user enters less than 3 symptoms, it asks to enter more symptoms to diagnose their state. Finally, it compares between flu and cold counter to print the result.
